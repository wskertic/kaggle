Link masks to images
    x --> [patient]_[img#].tif
    y --> [patient]_[img#]_Mask.tif

Use positive masked images to identify Brachial Plexus

Use minimum difference to identify 'patients'
--> Cluster "patients" based on image similarity (difference)
--> Predict "patient"
-->

Good idea to identify 'patient' clusters?
-> Identify "patients"
-> Use "patient's" well defined masks to inform "patient's" blank masks


Potential Obstacles:
**  Image orientation (flip/rotate)
**  Images without Brachial Plexus object
    --  Resolved by "patient" clustering
