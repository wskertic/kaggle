Cluster / Unsupervised classification of images
Likelihood Maximization of Species given features for each clustered class


To cluster images, start with list of species, add all image names that belong to species.

For unidentified species, maximize ssim across all available species, add it to best match.

To maximize ssim must consider all images already in the species set. Maximize sum of ssim for species set.

First group similar shapes, then sub-group similar textures/ other features

NEED TO FIX how images load into array for cv2.ml.trainEM(), they need to be in a single column, one image per row.... array for each individual image can likely be transformed into a 1 row by X column array & the array of images can be X rows (1584 for entirety of training data or less obviously for cross-validation) so X rows by 1 column (containing an image array on every row).
